# hello-world
This is my first repository to get familiar with Git

I wan't to becomea  data scientist. I stopped by undergraduate degree in Physics at UCSB for this career path and I am very excited. 
I have already done a few internships and solo projects that have given me more joy than any physics homework I ever did.
